# Usage Instructions

Follow these simple steps to use the `myscript`:

1. Move the script to the `/usr/local/bin/` directory using the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo mv myscript.sh /usr/local/bin/
    ```

2. Make the script executable by running:

    ```bash
    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/myscript.sh
    ```

3. Optionally, you can rename your script to "myscript" to use it as a command. This can be done using the following command:

    ```bash
    mv /usr/local/bin/myscript.sh /usr/local/bin/myscript
    ```

4. Now you can execute your script by typing:

    ```bash
    myscript
    ```

Feel free to customize the script name and adjust the paths as needed for your specific use case.
